react ui testing

first roadblock was that i kept encountering const { getbyrole } in some examples and screen.getbyrole in others which made me unsure of what to use and what to practice with.
i wanted to know why each one was used and when. i learned that destructuring the object returned by render is no longer a best practice so i decided i'll be using screen object methods provided by the react testing library

two resources that helped me a lot:
